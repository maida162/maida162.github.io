    <h1>About us</h1>
    <h2>History:</h2>
    <p>
        Sole was founded in 1992 by Robert Greenberg, who had previously founded LA Gear in 1983 (he stepped down as CEO
        of that company the same year he founded Sole). Greenberg sought to focus on men's street shoes; sole' early
        products were utility-style boots popular in grunge fashion. Sole is the third largest footwear brand
        in the United States by revenue. In January 2019, the company started an expansion of its corporate headquarters to
        double its office, design and showroom space in the South Bay. In 2023, Sole had its debut on the Fortune 500.

        Sole designs, develops and markets a range of lifestyle and performance footwear, apparel and accessories for 
        adults and children. Its brands include sole Sport, Slip-ins, D'Lites, the charity line Bobs, Mark Nason,
        Sole Work, Go Walk, Go Run, and Go Golf. Since 2020, select shoes have utilized Goodyear rubber.

        Sole Performance has featured distance runner Meb Keflezighi and professional golfers Brooke Henderson and Matt
        Fitzpatrick. In 2022, the brand expanded into pickleball, signing several of the sport's top players and sponsoring
        the first nationally televised pickleball tournament in the U.S. In autumn 2023, Sole announced a move into
        soccer and basketball, introducing new technical shoes worn and promoted by England national football team player
        Harry Kane and NBA players Julius Randle and Terance Mann.
